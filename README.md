# Overview
- Kaaler is an interactive color prototyping tool for visualising harmonious color palettes on a UI.

# Why?
1. It is difficult for people without an understanding of color theory to come up a suitable color palette for their website.
2. Most color generators online provide colors in isolation and do not provide a visualisation of how the colors will look on a website.

# Features
- Generate a harmonious color palette with copyable color codes
- Visualisation of the color palette using mock UI
- Ability to create custom palettes from color picker
- Ability to lock selected colors and generate a new palette from those colors
